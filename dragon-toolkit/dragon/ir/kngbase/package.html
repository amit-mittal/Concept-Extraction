<h2>Package Specification</h2>
A knowledge base is actually a matrix for semantic relationships between various concepts. For example, a row may stand for a multiword phrase, 
e.g. space program and a column denote a signle word. Thus a cell in the matrix may be interpreted as the probability of the phrase beging translated 
to the single word semantically.

<body bgcolor="white">A package for document clustering and its evaluation

<h2>Package Specification</h2>
The toolkit implements two common clustering approaches, the agglomerative approach and the K-Means approach.
These two approaches have many variants in terms of similarity measures. The toolkit encapsulates the details 
of different similarity measures into the implementations of two interfaces, Doc Distance and Cluster Model, respectively.  
The Doc Distance interface computes the distance between two documents and is designed for agglomerative clustering approaches. 
The Cluster Model interface computes the distance between a document and a cluster or the generative probability of a document by a cluster model. 
To evaluate cluster quality, please call dragon.ir.clustering.ClusteringEva.

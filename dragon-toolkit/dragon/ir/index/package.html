<h2>Package Specification</h2>
There are two important interfaces. One is indexer which index articles in a corpus. The other is index reader which read out indexing results. 
The dragon toolkit supports two modes of indexing. The first mode saves the indexing results into disk-based files and ususally fit for large
collections. The second mode keeps all information in the memory. The second mode is very conveient and fast, but for small collections only, e.g. 
collections for text summarization.

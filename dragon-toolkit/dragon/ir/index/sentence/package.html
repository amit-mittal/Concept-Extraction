<body bgcolor="white">A package for sentence-level indexing and indexing result read

<h2>Package Specification</h2>
The sentence indexing is almost the same as basic indexing except that it splits an article into sentences first and then treats each 
sentence as a document for indexing. In other words, in the doc-term matrix resulted by sentence indexing, each document actually 
denotes a sentence. The sentence indexing could be used for sentence-level summarizations. The sentence indexing also has two modes, online
mode and disk-based mode.

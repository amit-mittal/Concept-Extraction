<h2>Package Specification</h2>
The toolkit has implemented various language model smoothing methods as well as traditional probabilistic and vector space models. To create 
a new smoother, one should implement an interface called Smoother. Basically, given a document, a query term, and its frequency in the document,
the smoother should return a score to the searcher. For language models, the score means the probability of the doucment generating the term.

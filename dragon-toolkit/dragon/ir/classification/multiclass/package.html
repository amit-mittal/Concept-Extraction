<body bgcolor="white">Reducing multi-class classification to binary classifiers.

<h2>Package Specification</h2>
Some classifiers such as support vector machines (SVM) can only handle two-class classification problem. If the classification involves
multi classes, it has to reduce the multi-class classification to a set of binary classifiers and then combine results from all binary
classifiers to predict the label of an example.

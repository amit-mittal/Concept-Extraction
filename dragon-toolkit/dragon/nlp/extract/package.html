<h2>Package Specification</h2>
The toolkit defines three types of concept extractors. The first is token extractor, which extracts a sequence of individual words from a 
sentence or a document. The second is phrase extractor, namely extracting multiword phrases from a sentence or a document. The phrase 
extractor needs a phrase dictionary as input; the phrase dictionary could be automatically built by phrase tools such as Xtract. The third 
is term extractor, which extracts ontological terms from a sentence or a document.

<body bgcolor="white">A package for matrix (both dense matrix and sparse matrix) storage, read, write and operations.

<h2>Package Specification</h2>
The dragon toolkit uses its own technique for sparse matrix. All sparse matrix classes should implement an interface called SparseMatrix. The 
toolkit has included three implmentations, flat sparse matrix, super sparse matrix, and giant sparse matrix for matrix in different size. The flat
sparse matrix load all data into memory and thus very fast, but fit for small dataset only. The super sparse matrix will load index into the memory
and cache a given number of rows. The giant sparse matrix load nothing into the memory except caching the most recent row.

<body bgcolor="white">Various feature types for conditional random field applications.

<h2>Package Specification</h2>
A feature type is actually a feature generator. It can generate a given type of features from a fragment of a sequence. One should implement the interface called 
FeatureType to create own feature types. For saving time, one can extend the Abstract FeatureType instead of coding from the sctratch.
